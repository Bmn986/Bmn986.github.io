        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
            Hello! I’m Brandon Noey, a passionate individual on a transformative journey from grocery store manager to the exciting realm of cybersecurity. Here’s a glimpse into my story:
        </p>
        <h2>The Spark of Curiosity</h2>
        <p>
            Ever since I can remember, I’ve been drawn to the intricate world of computer science and software engineering. However, fear and self-doubt held me back. I thought I was too old to switch careers, and the prospect of failure loomed large. But life has a way of presenting opportunities when we least expect them.
        </p>
        <h2>Seizing the Opportunity</h2>
        <p>
            When my wife secured a job in Austin, Texas, it was a turning point. I realized that this was my chance to break free from the monotony of manual labor and pursue my passion. With determination and a leap of faith, I embarked on a new path—the path of cybersecurity.
        </p>
        <h2>The Cybersecurity Bootcamp</h2>
        <p>
            Fast forward to today—I’m three months into the cybersecurity bootcamp at The Tech Academy. Every day, I immerse myself in the world of ethical hacking, network security, and digital forensics. The challenges are real, but so is my commitment. I’m learning to protect systems, detect vulnerabilities, and safeguard data. And guess what? I’ve never felt more alive!
        </p>
        <h2>Looking Up</h2>
        <p>
            Gone are the days of uninspiring workplaces. Now, I’m surrounded by mentors, role models, and fellow learners who share my passion. I’m no longer afraid of failure; instead, I see it as a stepping stone toward growth. As I hone my skills, I’m building a foundation for a meaningful career—one that aligns with my interests and values.
        </p>
        <h2>Let’s Connect!</h2>
        <p>
            Whether you’re a fellow cybersecurity enthusiast, a mentor, or someone curious about this field, I’d love to connect. Feel free to reach out—I’m always up for a good tech chat!
        </p>
